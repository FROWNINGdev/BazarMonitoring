# üë• Collaboration Guide

This document describes the process of collaborative work on the project and creating co-authored commits.

## ü§ù Co-authored Commits

### Method 1: Through Commit Message (GitHub UI)

When creating a commit through the GitHub interface, add co-authors:

```
feat: add new feature

Co-authored-by: Colleague Name <email@example.com>
```

GitHub will automatically recognize this and show both authors in the commit history.

### Method 2: Through Command Line

#### Option A: Co-authored-by trailer

```bash
git commit -m "feat: collaborative work on feature

Detailed description of changes...

Co-authored-by: Colleague Name <email@example.com>"
```

#### Option B: Multiple authors

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new feature

Co-authored-by: First Participant <first@example.com>
Co-authored-by: Second Participant <second@example.com>"
```

### Method 3: Git config setup

If you work together regularly:

```bash
# Set multiple authors
git config user.name "Your Name and Colleague Name"
git config user.email "your-email@example.com"

# Or use for specific commit
git -c user.name="Your Name and Colleague Name" \
    -c user.email="your-email@example.com" \
    commit -m "feat: collaborative work"
```

## üìù Commit Message Examples

### With one co-author

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add camera monitoring feature

Co-authored-by: Your Colleague <colleague@example.com>"
```

### With multiple co-authors

```bash

Co-authored-by: Developer 1 <dev1@example.com>

```

```

## üîÑ Collaboration Process

### Step 1: Agreement on Changes

Before starting work:
- Discuss the task in Issues or Discussion
- Divide responsibility between participants
- Agree on implementation approach

### Step 2: Create Branch

```bash
# One participant creates a branch
git checkout -b feature/joint-feature

# Or use a shared branch
git checkout -b feature/collaboration-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

### Step 3: Work on Code

Each participant works on their part:
- Participant 1: Backend changes
- Participant 2: Frontend changes
- Or pair programming

### Step 4: Commits

#### Option A: Separate commits from each

```bash
# Participant 1 makes commit
git commit -m "feat(backend): add new endpoint"

# Participant 2 makes commit
git commit -m "feat(frontend): add UI for new endpoint"
```

#### Option B: Joint commit

```bash
# One participant creates commit with co-authors
git add .
git commit -m "feat: complete feature implementation

Backend: added API endpoint
Frontend: added UI component

Co-authored-by: Backend Dev <backend@example.com>
Co-authored-by: Frontend Dev <frontend@example.com>"
```

### Step 5: Push and Pull Request

```bash
# Push branch
git push origin feature/joint-feature

# Create Pull Request on GitHub
# Mention all participants in PR description
```

## üìã Pull Request Template for Collaboration
